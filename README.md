## Important Notes

1. **Jenkinsfile is Partial**: The diff only showed a small snippet of the Jenkinsfile (removal of a comment), so only the visible portion was recreated. The complete file would have more content.

2. **Security Warning**: The backend.py file contains intentionally insecure code for testing security scanners. DO NOT use in production!

3. **File Structure**: All files are organized in the `recreated_files/` directory maintaining their original directory structure.
